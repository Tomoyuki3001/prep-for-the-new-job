# AI Task Architect Prep

This repository is a dedicated preparation workspace for my upcoming role as a Platform/LLM Application Engineer. It focuses on the intersection of modern Frontend (Next.js) and AI integration patterns.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Gemini API (free)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Key Learnings & Features
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Implemented custom API routes in `/src/app/api` to handle prompt processing.
- **Data Integrity**: Developed "Defensive Parsing" and TypeScript interfaces to sanitize unpredictable AI outputs.
- **Streaming Simulation**: Built a mock streaming UI using React functional state updates to mimic real-time LLM token generation.
- **Security**: Configured environment variable management for secure API key handling.
